# trans-c-quadratics
Trans-C quadratic example codes

These form part of my Honours project at ANU, and build on the code at [https://github.com/inlab-geo/pyTransC](https://github.com/inlab-geo/pyTransC)


These examples take datapoints and put them through the Trans-C process, rather than using pre-processed data or simply starting from Gaussian PDFs.
